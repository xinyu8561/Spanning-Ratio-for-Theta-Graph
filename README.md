# Spanning-Ratio-for-Theta-Graph
For the report part, I wrote the history for spanners, different proofs toward a better upperbound for spanning ratio, and theta4,5,6.

For the experiment part, I test the different upperbounds for spanning ratios in some special cases of paper “Towards Tight Bounds on Theta-Graphs”
